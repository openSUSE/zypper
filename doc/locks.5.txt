NAME
----
locks - libzypp locking file


DESCRIPTION
-----------
The file '/etc/zypp/locks' is read by libzypp at start-up if 'zypp.conf' allows it. The entries are used for initial locking of packages. Locking a package means not allowing to install or uninstall it.

Valid entries are of the form:

'attribute'*:* 'value'::
      Where attributes and their values are described below.

Locks are separated by an empty lines.


ATTRIBUTES
----------
All attributes are lower-case.

*repo*::
	specifies repository restriction. Only alias is accepted. +
	By default all repositories match.

*type*::
	resolvable type restriction. The values can be *package*, *patch*, *pattern*, *product* and *srcpackage*. +
	By default all types match.


*case_sensitive*::
	if strings are matched case sensitive. The values are *true*, *false*, *on*, *off*. +
	The default is case insensitive.


*install_status*::
	status of object. Possible states are *installed*, *not-installed* and *all*. If more install statuses are specified then the last one is used. The values are *installed* for all packages which are installed, *non-installed* for packages which can be installed or reinstalled and *all* for both. +
	The default is *all*.


*match_type*::
	type of string matching in values. Does not affect *type* and *repo* which must be specified exactly. The values are *exact*, *substring*, *regex* for regular expressions, *glob* for matching as on the command line, and *word*. +
	The default is *substring*.

*query_string*::
	String to be matched in multiple attributes. Should be restricted by another attribute with empty value (it is recommended, because without restriction expect some performance problems).

*version*::
	Restrict the lock only to some versions. It contains two parts: an optional operator and the version. +
	The operator is *==*, *!=*, *<*, *>*, *<=*, *>=*.  If operator is not specified then *==* is used. +
	The version has the format ['epoch'*:*+]+'version'[*-*'release']. +
	Example: *version: < 0:0.11.4-2*

*solvable_name*::
	name of object (e.g. zypper)

*solvable_summary*::
	summary of object

*solvable_arch*::
	architecture of object (e.g. x86_64, i586)

*solvable_description*::
	description of object

*solvable_eula*::
	license text of objects which request accepting license by user

*solvable_license*::
	license of package (only for package) (e.g. GPL2)

*solvable_keywords*::
	keywords which specify package (only for package)

*solvable_authors*::
	authors of package (only for package)

*solvable_group*::
	package group (only for package) (e.g. Development/Tools/Version Control )

*update_reference_type*::
	reference for update (e.g. bugzilla,cve) (only for patches)


EXAMPLES
--------
*Exact Package*::
	This is the way YaST UI does it. Lock k3b (e.g. you don't want to update it).
--------------------
-----locks-----
type: package
solvable_name: k3b
match_type: exact
case_sensitive: on
--------------------

*Package Wildcard*::
	This is the way "zypper addlock cross-*-gcc-icecream-backend" does it.
--------------------
-----locks-----
type: package
solvable_name: cross-*-gcc-icecream-backend
match_type: glob
case_sensitive: on
--------------------

*Versioned Lock*::
	Do not install new GCC. This format is used when converting from the openSUSE-10.3 lock format.
--------------------
-----locks-----
solvable_name: gcc
match_type: glob
version: > 4.2
--------------------

*Anything named KDE*::
	Locks everything which contains kde in the name.
--------------------
-----locks-----
solvable_name: kde
--------------------

*Anything mentioning KDE*::
	Locks everything which contains kde in the name, summary, or description.
--------------------
-----locks-----

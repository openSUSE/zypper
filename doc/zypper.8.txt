NAME
----
zypper - Command-line interface to ZYpp system management library (libzypp)


SYNOPSIS
--------
*zypper* ['--global-opts'] 'command' ['--command-opts'] ['command-arguments']

*zypper* *help* 'command'


DESCRIPTION
-----------
zypper is a command-line interface to ZYpp system management library (libzypp). It can be used to install, update, remove software, manage repositories, perform various queries, and more.


CONCEPTS
--------
Most of the following concepts are common for all applications based on the libzypp package management library, but there are some zypper specifics.

Repositories
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Libzypp works with package metadata, that is information about packages and their relations extracted from RPM packages and other data like patch information, pattern definitions, etc. These data are stored together with the RPM files in folders called 'repositories'. Repositories can be placed on various media like an HTTP or FTP server, DVD, or a folder on a local disc.

There is a special set of commands in zypper intended to manipulate repositories. Also many commands and options take a repository as an argument. See section *COMMANDS*, subsection *Repository Management* for more details.

Resource Identifiers (URI)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To specify locations of repositories or other resources (RPM files, .repo files) you can use any type of URIs supported by libzypp. See section *COMMANDS*, subsection *Repository Management* for a complete list and usage examples.

Zypper also accepts special URIs identifying openSUSE Build Service (OBS) repositories in the *addrepo* command. These URIs have the form of *obs://*'project'*/*['platform'], where 'project' is the name of the OBS project and 'platform' is the target platform (OS) for which the repository is intended. If 'platform' is omitted, the *obs.platform* value from zypper.conf is used. See also other options in the [obs] section of zypper.conf.

For example: *obs://server:http/openSUSE_11.3*.

In addition to these URIs you can use plain directory and file paths in which case zypper automatically treats them as *dir:/*'path' URI.

Refresh
~~~~~~~
Refreshing a repository means downloading metadata of packages from the medium (if needed), storing it in local cache (typically under */var/cache/zypp/raw/*'alias' directory) and preparsing the metadata into '.solv' files (building the solv cache), typically under */var/cache/zypp/solv/*'alias'.

The metadata get refreshed either automatically or on user request. An 'automatic refresh' takes place right before reading metadata from the database if the *auto-refresh is enabled* for the repository and the metadata is reported to be out of date. If the 'auto-refresh is disabled', the repository will only be refreshed on user request. You can request a refresh by calling *zypper refresh* (see the documentation of the *refresh* command for details).

The repository metadata are checked for changes before actually doing the refresh. A change is detected by downloading one or two metadata index files (small files) and comparing the checksums of the cached ones and the remote ones. If the files differ, the repository is out of date and will be refreshed.

To delay the up-to-date check (and thus the automatic refresh) for a certain number of minutes, edit the value of the *repo.refresh.delay* attribute of ZYpp config file (*/etc/zypp/zypp.conf*). This means, zypper will not even try to download and check the index files, and you will be able to use zypper for operations like search or info without internet access or root privileges.

Services
~~~~~~~~
Services are one level above repositories and serve to manage repositories or to do some special tasks. Libzypp currently supports 'Repository Index Service' (RIS) and 'Plugin Service'.

Repository Index Service (RIS) is a special type of repository which contains a list of other repositories. This list can be generated dynamically by the server according to some URI parameters or user name, or can be static. Once such service is added to your system, zypper takes care of adding, modifying, or removing these repositories on your system to reflect the current list. See section *Service Management* and http://old-en.opensuse.org/Standards/Repository_Index_Service for more details.

Package Types
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Zypper works with several types of resource objects, called 'resolvables'. A resolvable might be a *package*, *patch*, *pattern*, *product*; basically any 'kind of object' with dependencies to other objects.

*package*::
	An ordinary RPM package.
*patch*::
	A released patch conflicts with the affected/vulnerable versions of a collection of packages. As long as any of these affected/vulnerable versions are installed, the conflict triggers and the patch is classified as *needed*. Selecting the patch, the conflict is resolved by updating all installed and affected/vulnerable packages to a version providing the fix. When updating the packages zypper always aims for the latest available version.
*pattern*::
	A group of packages required or recommended to install some functionality.
*product*::
	A group of packages which are necessary to install a product.
*srcpackage*::
	Source code package (.src.rpm). This type works in *search* and *install* commands.
*application*::
	Focuses on packages a user might want to install and hide away supporting packages which are selected via package dependencies anyway (see 'http://people.freedesktop.org/~hughsient/appdata/')

Throughout this manual we will often refer to resolvables simply as 'packages' and to resolvable types as 'package type' or 'kind'. These type names can be used as arguments of *--type* option in several commands like *install*, *info*, or *search*. Commands should also allow to specify resolvables as 'KIND'*:*'NAME' (e.g. *patch:openSUSE-2014-7*).

Package Dependencies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Software packages depend on each other in various ways. Packages usually 'require' or 'recommend' other packages, but they can also 'conflict' with other packages. Packages can also support specific hardware or language settings. Zypper uses a 'dependency solver' to find out what packages need to be installed to satisfy the user's request. See http://old-en.opensuse.org/Software_Management/Dependencies for more information.

Package File Conflicts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
File conflicts happen when two packages attempt to install files with the same name but different contents. This may happen if you are installing a newer version of a package without erasing the older version, of if two unrelated packages each install a file with the same name.

As checking for file conflicts requires access to the full filelist of each package being installed, zypper will check for file conflict only if all packages are downloaded in advance (see *--download-in-advance*).

As the reason for file conflicts usually is a poor package design or lack of coordination between the the people building the packages, they are not easy to resolve. By using the *--replacefiles* option you can force zypper to replace the conflicting files. Nevertheless this may damage the package whose file gets replaced.

COMMANDS
--------
zypper provides a number of 'commands'. Each command accepts the options listed in the *GLOBAL OPTIONS* section. These options must be specified 'before' the command name. In addition, many commands have specific options, which are listed in this section. These command-specific options must be specified 'after' the name of the command and 'before' any of the command arguments.

General Commands
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
*help* ['command']::
	Shows help texts. If invoked without any argument (just *zypper* or *zypper help*), zypper displays global help text which lists all available global options and commands.
	+
	If invoked with a 'command' name argument, zypper displays help for the specified command, if such command exists. Long as well as short variants of the command names can be used.
	+
	For your convenience, *zypper help* can also be invoked in any of the following ways:

[horizontal]
	;; $ *zypper -h*|*--help* ['command']
	;; $ *zypper* ['command'] *-h*|*--help*


*shell* (*sh*)::
	Starts a shell for entering multiple commands in one session. Exit the shell using *exit*, *quit*, or 'Ctrl-D'.
	+
	The shell support is not complete so expect bugs there. However, there's no urgent need to use the shell since libzypp became so fast thanks to the SAT solver and its tools (openSUSE 11.0), but still, you're welcome to experiment with it.


Package Management Commands
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
*info* (*if*) ['options'] 'name'...::
	Displays detailed information about the specified packages.
	+
	For each specified package, zypper finds the best available version in defined repositories and shows information for this package.
+
--
	*-r*, *--repo* 'alias'|'name'|'#'|'URI'::
		Work only with the repository specified by the alias, name, number or URI. This option can be used multiple times.

	*-t*, *--type* 'type'::
		Type of package (default: package). See section *Package Types* for list of available package types.
	*--provides*::
		Show symbols the package provides.

	*--requires*::
		Show symbols the package requires.

	*--conflicts*::
		Show symbols the package conflicts with.

	*--obsoletes*::
		Show symbols the package obsoletes.

	*--recommends*::
		Show symbols the package recommends.

	*--suggests*::
		Show symbols the package suggests.

	Examples: :: {nop}

		$ *zypper info workrave*;;
		Show information about 'package workrave'

		$ *zypper info -t patch libzypp*;;
		Show information about 'patch libzypp'

		$ *zypper info -t pattern lamp_server*;;
		Show information about 'pattern lamp_server'
--

*install* (*in*) ['options'] 'name'|'capability'|'rpm_file_uri'...::
	Install or update packages.

	The packages can be selected by their 'name' or by a 'capability' they provide.;;
		+
		A 'capability' is formed by "'NAME'[*.*'ARCH'][ 'OP EDITION']", where 'ARCH' is an architecture code, 'OP' is one of *<*, *\<=*, *=*, *>=*, or *>* and 'EDITION' is "'VERSION'[*-*'RELEASE']". For example: *zypper=0.8.8-2*
		+
		The 'NAME' component of a capability is not only a package name but any symbol provided by packages: */bin/vi*, *libcurl.so.3*, *perl(Time::ParseDate)*. Just remember to quote to protect the special characters from the shell, for example: *zypper\>0.8.10* or *\'zypper>0.8.10'*.
		+
		If 'EDITION' is not specified, the newest installable version will be installed. This also means that if the package is already installed and newer versions are available, it will get upgraded to the newest installable version.
		+
		If 'ARCH' is not specified, or the last dot of the capability name string is not followed by known architecture, the solver will treat the whole string as a capability name. If the ARCH is known, the solver will select a package matching that architecture and complain if such package cannot be found.

	Zypper is also able to install 'plain RPM files' while trying to satisfy their dependencies using packages from defined repositories. You can install a plain RPM file by specifying its location in the install command arguments either as a local path or an URI. E.g.: ;;
		+
		$ *zypper install ~/rpms/foo.rpm http://some.site/bar.rpm*.
		+
		Zypper will report packages that it cannot find. Further, in interactive mode, zypper proceeds with installation of the rest of requested packages, and it will abort immediately in non-interactive mode. In both cases zypper returns *ZYPPER_EXIT_INF_CAP_NOT_FOUND* after finishing the operation.
		+
		Zypper will download the files into its cache directory (/var/cache/zypper/RPMS), add this directory as a temporary *plaindir* repository and mark the respective packages for installation.

	In the install command, you can specify also packages you wish to remove in addition to the packages you wish to install, by prepending their names by a '-' or '~' character. For example: ;;
		+
		$ '*zypper install vim -emacs*'{nbsp}
		+
		$ *zypper remove emacs +vim*{nbsp}
		+
		will both 'install vim' and 'remove emacs'. Note that if you choose to use *-* with the first package you specify, you need to write *--* before it to prevent its interpretation as a command option:
		+
		$ *zypper install -- -boring-game great-game great-game-manual*{nbsp}

+
--
	-r, --repo alias|name|#|URI::
		Work only with the repository specified by the alias, name, number or URI. This option can be used multiple times.
		+
		Using --repo is 'discouraged' as it currently hides unmentioned repositories from the resolver, leading to inexpertly decisions. In the future --repo will become an alias for *--from*.

	*-t*, *--type* 'type'::
		Type of package to install (default: package). See section *Package Types* for list of available package types. Use '*zypper se -t* type' ['name'] to look for available items of this type and '*zypper info -t* type name' to display more detailed information about the item.
		+
		If 'patch' is specified, zypper will install and/or remove packages to satisfy specified patch. This is a way to ensure that specific bug fix is installed. Use *zypper list-patches* to look for available 'needed' patches.
		+
		If 'product' or 'pattern' are specified, zypper ensures that all required (and optionally recommended) packages are installed.

	*-n*, *--name*::
		Select packages by their name, don't try to select by capabilities.

	*-f*, *--force*::
		Install even if the item is already installed (reinstall), downgraded or changes vendor or architecture.

	*--oldpackage*::
		Allow to replace a newer item with an older one. Handy if you are doing a rollback. Unlike --force it will not enforce a reinstall, if the item is already installed with the requested version.

	*--from* 'alias|name|#|URI'::
		Select packages from specified repository. If strings specified as arguments to the install command match packages in repositories specified in this option, they will be marked for installation. This option currently implies *--name*, but allows using wildcards for specifying packages.

	*-C*, *--capability*::
		Select packages by capabilities.

	*-l*, *--auto-agree-with-licenses*::
		Automatically say 'yes' to third party license confirmation prompt. By using this option, you choose to agree with licenses of all third-party software this command will install. This option is particularly useful for administrators installing the same set of packages on multiple machines (by an automated process) and have the licenses confirmed before.

	*--debug-solver*::
		Create solver test case for debugging. Use this option, if you think the dependencies were not solved all right and attach the resulting /var/log/zypper.solverTestCase directory to your bug report. To use this option, simply add it to the problematic install or remove command.

	*--no-recommends*::
		By default, zypper installs also packages recommended by the requested ones. This option causes the recommended packages to be ignored and only the required ones to be installed.

	*--replacefiles*::
		Install the packages even if they replace files from other, already installed, packages. Default is to treat file conflicts as an error. *--download-as-needed* disables the file conflict check because access to all packages file lists is needed in advance in order to perform the check.

	*-R*, *--no-force-resolution*::
		Do not force the solver to find a solution. Instead, report dependency problems and prompt the user to resolve them manually.

	*--force-resolution*::
		Force the solver to find a solution by allowing to remove packages with unfulfilled requirements. This is the default when removing packages (*zypper remove *). This option overrides *--no-force-resolution* in case both are specified on the command line.

	*-D*, *--dry-run*::
		Test the installation, do not actually install any package. This option will add the *--test* option to the rpm commands run by the install command.

	*--details*::
		Show the detailed installation summary.

	Download-and-install mode options: :: {nop}

	*-d*, *--download-only*::
		Only download the packages for later installation.

	*--download-in-advance*::
		First download all packages, then start installing.

	*--download-in-heaps*::
		Download a minimal set of packages that can be installed without leaving
		the system in broken state, and install them. Then download and install another
		heap until all are installed. This helps to keep the system in consistent state
		without the need to download 'all' packages in advance, which combines the
		advantages of *--download-in-advance* and *--download-as-needed*.
		This is the default mode.
		+
		NOTE: While the resolver is not capable of building heaps, this behaves the same as *--download-in-advance*.

	*--download-as-needed*::
		Download one package, install it immediately, and continue with the rest
		until all are installed.

	*--download* 'mode'::
		Use the specified download-and-install mode. Available modes are:
		*only*, *in-advance*, *in-heaps*, *as-needed*.
		See corresponding *--download-*'mode' options for their description.

	Examples: :: {nop}

		$ *zypper install -t pattern lamp_server*;;
		Install lamp_server pattern.

		$ *zypper install --no-recommends gv*;;
		Install GhostScript viewer, but ignore recommended packages.

		$ *zypper install virtualbox-ose-2.0.6*;; {nop}
		$ *zypper install virtualbox-ose=2.0.6*;; {nop}
		$ *zypper install virtualbox-ose = 2.0.6*;;
		Install version 2.0.6 of virtualbox-ose package.
--

*source-install* (*si*) 'name'...::
	Install specified source packages and their build dependencies. If the name of a binary package is given, the corresponding source package is looked up and installed instead.
	+
	This command will try to find the newest available versions of the source packages and uses *rpm -i* to install them and the packages that are required to build the source package.
	+
	Note that the source packages must be available in repositories you are using. You can check whether a repository contains any source packages using the following command:

	;; $ '*zypper search -t srcpackage -r* alias'|'name'|'#'|'URI'

+
--
	*-d*, *--build-deps-only*::
		Install only build dependencies of specified packages.

	*-D*, *--no-build-deps*::
		Don't install build dependencies.

	*-r*, *--repo* 'alias'|'name'|'#'|'URI'::
		Work only with the repository specified by the alias, name, number, or URI. This option can be used multiple times.

	*--download-only*::
		Only download the packages, do not install.

	Examples: :: {nop}

		$ *zypper si -d dbus-1*;;
		Install build dependencies of dbus-1 source package.
--

*verify* (*ve*) ['options']::
	Check whether dependencies of installed packages are satisfied.
	+
	In case that any dependency problems are found, zypper suggests packages to install or remove to fix them.
+
--
	*--no-recommends*::
		By default, zypper installs also packages recommended by the requested ones (the ones needed to fix broken dependencies in this case). This option causes the recommended packages to be ignored and only the required ones to be installed.

	*-D*, *--dry-run*::
		Test the repair, do not actually do anything to the system.

	*--details*::
		Show the detailed installation summary.

	*-r*, *--repo* 'alias'|'name'|'#'|'URI'::
		Work only with the repository specified by the alias, name, number, or URI. This option can be used multiple times.

	*--debug-solver*::
		Create solver test case for debugging. See the install command for details.
--

*install-new-recommends* (*inr*) ['options']::
	Install newly added packages recommended by already installed ones. This can typically be used to install language packages recently added to repositories or drivers for newly added hardware.
+
--
	*-r*, *--repo* 'alias'|'name'|'#'|'URI'::
		Work only with the repository specified by the alias, name, number, or URI. This option can be used multiple times.

	*-D*, *--dry-run*::
		Test the installation, do not actually install anything.

	*--details*::
		Show the detailed installation summary.

	*--debug-solver*::
		Create solver test case for debugging. See the install command for details.

	This command also accepts the *Download-and-install mode options* described in the *install* command.:: {nop}
--

*remove* (*rm*) ['options'] 'name'...:: {nop}
*remove* (*rm*) ['options'] *--capability* 'capability'...::
	Remove (uninstall) packages.
	+
	The packages can be selected by their name or by a capability they provide. For details on package selection see the *install* command description.
+
--
	*-r*, *--repo* 'alias'|'name'|'#'|'URI'::
		Work only with the repository specified by the alias, name, number, or URI. This option can be used multiple times.

	*-t*, *--type* 'type'::
		Type of package (default: package). See section *Package Types* for list of available package types.
		+
		Since *patches* are not installed in sense of copying files or recording a database entry, they cannot be uninstalled, even though zypper shows them as installed. The installed status is determined solely based on the installed status of its required dependencies. If these dependencies are satisfied, the patch is rendered installed.

	*-n*, *--name*::
		Select packages by their name (default).

	*-C*, *--capability*::
		Select packages by capabilities.

	*--debug-solver*::
		Create solver test case for debugging. See the install command for details.

	*-R*, *--no-force-resolution*::
		Do not force the solver to find a solution. Instead, report dependency problems and prompt the user to resolve them manually.

	*--force-resolution*::
		Force the solver to find a solution by allowing to remove packages with unfulfilled requirements. This is the default when removing packages (*zypper remove *). This option overrides *--no-force-resolution* in case both are specified on the command line.

	*-u*, *--clean-deps*::
		Automatically remove dependencies which become unneeded after removal of requested packages.

	*-U*, *--no-clean-deps*::
		No automatic removal of unneeded dependencies.

	*-D*, *--dry-run*::
		Test the removal of packages, do not actually remove anything. This option will add the *--test* option to the rpm commands run by the remove command.

	*--details*::
		Show the detailed installation summary.

Update Management Commands
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*list-updates* (*lu*) ['options']::
	List available updates.
	+
	This command will list only installable updates, i.e. updates which have no dependency problems, or which do not change package vendor. This list is what the *update* command will propose to install. To list all packages for which newer version are available, use *--all* option.
+
--
	*-t*, *--type* 'type'::
		Type of package (default: package). See section *Package Types* for list of available package types.
		+
		If *patch* is specified, zypper acts as if the *list-patches* command was executed.

		See the *update* command for description.
--

*update* (*up*) ['options'] ['packagename']...::
	Update installed packages with newer versions, where possible.
	+
	This command will not update packages which would require change of package vendor unless the vendor is specified in */etc/zypp/vendors.d*, or which would require manual resolution of problems with dependencies. Such non-installable updates will then be listed in separate section of the summary as "'The following package updates will NOT be installed:'".
	+
	To update individual packages, specify one or more package names. You can use the *** and *?* wildcard characters in the package names to specify multiple packages matching the pattern.
+
--
	*-t*, *--type* 'type'::
		Type of package (default: package). See section *Package Types* for list of available package types.
		+
		If *patch* is specified, zypper acts as if the *patches* command was executed.

	*--replacefiles*::
		Install the packages even if they replace files from other, already installed, packages. Default is to treat file conflicts as an error. *--download-as-needed* disables the fileconflict check because access to all packages filelists is needed in advance in order to perform the check.

	*-R*, *--no-force-resolution*::
		Do not force the solver to find a solution. Instead, report dependency problems and prompt the user to resolve them manually.

	*--force-resolution*::
		Force the solver to find a solution by allowing to remove packages with unfulfilled requirements. This is the default when removing packages (*zypper remove *). This option overrides *--no-force-resolution* in case both are specified on the command line.

	*-D*, *--dry-run*::
		Test the update, do not actually install or update any package. This option will add the *--test* option to the rpm commands run by the update command.

	*--details*::

		Do a 'best effort' approach to update. This method does not explicitly select packages with best version and architecture, but instead requests installation of a package with higher version than the installed one and leaves the rest on the dependency solver. This method is always used for packages, and is optional for products and patterns. It is not applicable to patches.

	This command also accepts the download-and-install mode options described in the *install* command description.:: {nop}
--

*list-patches* (*lp*) ['options']::
	List all available needed patches.
	+
	This command is similar to *zypper list-updates -t patch*.

		Create test case for debugging of dependency resolver.

	*-D*, *--dry-run*::
		Test the update, do not actually update.


	*--details*::
		Show the detailed installation summary.

	This command also accepts the *download-and-install* mode options described in the *install* command description.:: {nop}
--

*dist-upgrade* (*dup*) ['options']::
	Perform a distribution upgrade. This command applies the state of (specified) repositories onto the system; upgrades (or even downgrades) installed packages to versions found in repositories, removes packages that are no longer in the repositories and pose a dependency problem for the upgrade, handles package splits and renames, etc.
	+
	If no repositories are specified via the *--from* option, zypper will do the upgrade with all defined repositories. This can be a problem if the system contains conflicting repositories, like repositories for two different distribution releases. This often happens if one forgets to remove an older release repository after adding a new one, say openSUSE 13.1 and openSUSE 13.2.
	+
	For all repositories which have the distribution version within their URL (like http://download.opensuse.org/distribution/'13.1'/repo/oss) using the *$releasever* variable instead may be helpful (http://download.opensuse.org/distribution/*$releasever*/repo/oss). The variable is per default substituted by the current distributions version ('13.1') This value can be overwritten using the *--releasever* global option. Calling *zypper --releasever 13.2*'...' will cause these repos to use the new location (http://download.opensuse.org/distribution/'13.2'/repo/oss) without need to add/remove anything. Once the *dup* is performed, *$releasever* will default to the new distribution version. See section *Repository Management* for more info about variable substitution.
	+
	Note: distribution upgrades in openSUSE are currently only supported between consecutive releases. To upgrade multiple releases, upgrade each consecutive release one at a time. For more details see *http://en.opensuse.org/SDB:System_upgrade* and the 'openSUSE release notes' at *http://doc.opensuse.org/release-notes/*.
+
--
	*--from* 'alias'|'name'|'#'|'URI'::
		Restricts the upgrade to the specified repositories (the option can be used multiple times) only, but can satisfy dependencies also from the rest of enabled repositories.

	-r, --repo alias|name|#|URI::
		Work only with the repository specified by the alias, name, number, or URI.
		+
		Using --repo is 'discouraged' as it currently hides unmentioned repositories from the resolver, leading to inexpertly decisions. In the future --repo will become an alias for *--from*.

	*-l*, *--auto-agree-with-licenses*::
		Automatically say 'yes' to third party license confirmation prompt. By using this option, you choose to agree with licenses of all third-party software this command will install. This option is particularly useful for administrators installing the same set of packages on multiple machines (by an automated process) and have the licenses confirmed before.

	*--no-recommends*::
		By default, zypper installs also packages recommended by the requested ones. This option causes the recommended packages to be ignored and only the required ones to be installed.

	*--replacefiles*::
		Install the packages even if they replace files from other, already installed, packages. Default is to treat file conflicts as an error. *--download-as-needed* disables the fileconflict check because access to all packages filelists is needed in advance in order to perform the check.

	*--debug-solver*::
		Create solver test case for debugging. See the install command for details.

	*-D*, *--dry-run*::
		Test the upgrade, do not actually install or update any package. This option will add the *--test* option to the rpm commands run by the dist-upgrade command.

	*--details*::
		Show the detailed installation summary.

	This command also accepts the download-and-install mode options described in the *install* command description.:: {nop}

	Examples: :: {nop}

		$ *zypper dup --from factory --from packman*;;
		Upgrade the system to the latest versions provided by the 'factory' and 'packman' repositories.
--

Query Commands
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
*search* (*se*) ['options'] ['querystring'|'capability']...::
	Search for packages matching any of the given search strings. *** and '*?* wildcard' characters can be used within search strings. If the search string is enclosed in */*  (e.g. */^k.*e$/*) it's interpreted as a 'regular expression'. See the *install* command for details about how to specify a 'capability'.
	+
	Results of the search are printed in a table. with columns *S*+tatus+, *Name*, *Type* of package, *Version*, *Arch*+itecture+ and *Repository*. The *S*+tatus+ column can contain the following values:

--
[horizontal]
	*i*;;	installed
	*v*;;	a different version is installed
	'empty';;	neither of the former cases
--
+
{nop}
	The *v* status is only shown if the version or the repository matters (see *--details* or *--repo*), and the installed version 	differs from the one listed or is from a repository other than specified.
	+
	This command accepts the following options:
+
--

Repository Management
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Zypper is able to work with YaST, RPM-MD (yum) software repositories, and plain directories containing .rpm files.

Repositories are primarily identified using their 'URI' or 'alias'. Alias serves as a shorthand for the long URI or name of the repository. The 'name' of the repository should briefly describe the repository and is shown to the user in tables and messages. The name is not required, and if not known, the alias is shown instead. The alias is required and uniquely identifies the repository on the system.

The 'alias', 'name', 'URI', or the 'number' from *zypper repos* list can be used to specify a repository as an argument of various zypper commands and options like *refresh*, *--repo*, or *--from*.

Apart from the above, repositories have several other properties which can be set using the commands described in this section below, or by manually editing the repository definition files (*.repo* files, see section *FILES*).

Variable substitution:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can use the following built-in variables within a *.repo* or *.service* files 'name' and 'URI' values:

	*$arch*:::
		Use this variable to refer to the system's CPU architecture.

	*$basearch*:::
		Use this variable to refer to the base architecture of the system. For example, iX86 machines have a base architecture of *i386*, while AMD64 and Intel64 have *x86_64*.

	*$releasever*:::
	*$releasever_major*:::
	*$releasever_minor*:::
		Use this variable to refer to the version of your openSUSE or SUSE Linux. The value is obtained from the '/product/version' XML-node in */etc/products.d/baseproduct*.
		+
		This is useful for related repositories like packman (*http://ftp.gwdg.de/pub/linux/packman/suse/$releasever*), which shall always fit the installed distribution, even after a distribution upgrade. To help performing a distribution upgrade, the value of *$releasever* can be overwritten using the *--releasever* global option. This way you can easily switch all repositories using *$releasever* to the new version (provided the server layouts did not change and new repos are already available).
		+
		In addition *$releasever_major* will be set to the leading portion up to (but not including) the 1st dot; *$releasever_minor* to the trailing portion after the 1st dot. If there's no dot in *$releasever*, *$releasever_major* is the same as *$releasever* and *$releasever_minor* is empty.

	Remember to protect the *$* when using these variables on a shell command line: :::
		zypper ar -f http://ftp.gwdg.de/pub/linux/packman/suse/*\$*{nop}releasever packman

	If a variable is followed by an alphanumeric character or underscore it needs to be enclosed in *{}*: :::
		zypper ar -f http://ftp.gwdg.de/pub/linux/packman/suse/*\${*'releasever'*}*{nop}_packman

	Bash style definition of default *${*'variable'*:-*'word'*}* and alternate *${*'variable'*:+*'word'*}* values: :::
		SLE-*${*'releasever_major'*}${*'releasever_minor'*:+*-SP-'$releasever_minor'*}*

	To check where you already use *$releasever* call: :::
		*zypper --releasever @--HERE--@ lr -u*


Supported URI formats:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

	'scheme'*:* [*//*['user'[*:*'password']'*@*']'host'[*:*'port']] */*'path' [*?*'query'] [*#*'fragment']:::
		Special characters occurring in URI components (like a '*@*' in a password) must be %-encoded ('*%40*').

	CD or DVD drive:::
		Optionally with 'devices' list for probing.
[horizontal]
		;; *cd:///*
		;; *dvd:/subdir*'?devices=/dev/sr0,/dev/sr1'

	FTP/HTTP/HTTPS directory tree:::
		The ftp URL scheme supports absolute and relative paths to the default ftp server directory (RFC1738, Section 3.2.2). To use an absolute path, you have to prepend the path with an additional slash, what results in a */%2f* combination (second */* encoded to *%2f*) at the begin of the URL path. This is important, especially in user authenticated ftp, where the users home is usually the default directory of the server (except when the server chroots into the users home directory).
		+
		Explicit proxy settings may be passed via optional parameters 'proxy', 'proxyport', 'proxyuser' and 'proxypass'.
		+
		HTTP authentication methods to use can be defined as comma separated list via optional parameter 'auth'. Valid methods are e.g. 'basic', 'digest', 'ntlm', 'negotiate'. Note, that this list depends on the list of methods supported by the curl library.
[horizontal]
		;; *ftp://user:pass@server/path/to/media/dir*
		;; *ftp://user:pass@server/%2fhome/user/path/to/media/dir*
		;; *http://user:pass@server/path*
		;; *https://user:pass@server/path*'?proxy=foo&proxyuser=me&proxypass=pw'

	Disk volume (partition):::
		Mandatory *device* parameter specifying the name of the block device to mount. The name of the optional 'filesystem' defaults to "auto".

		;; *hd:/subdir?device=/dev/sda1*'&filesystem=reiserfs'

	Local directory tree:::

		;; *dir:/directory/name*

	Media in an ISO image (loopback mounted):::
		+
		Mandatory *iso* parameter specifying the name of the iso file. Optional 'url' parameter specifying the URL to the directory containing the iso file. Optional 'mnt' parameter specifying the preferred attach point for the source media url. Optional 'filesystem' name of the filesystem used in the iso file. Defaults to "auto".
[horizontal]
		;; *iso:/?iso=CD1.iso*'&url=nfs://server/path/to/media'
		;; *iso:/?iso=CD1.iso*'&url=hd:/?device=/dev/hda'
		;; *iso:/subdir?iso=DVD1.iso*'&url=nfs://nfs-server/directory&mnt=/nfs/attach/point&filesystem=udf'

	NFS exported directory tree:::
		To use NFSv4 either use schema 'tnfsv4://' or pass an optional parameter 'type=nfs4'. Additional 'mountoptions' can be passed as comma separated list. Defaults to "ro".
[horizontal]
		;; *nfs://nfs-server/exported/path*
		;; *nfs://nfs-server/exported/path*'?mountoptions=ro&type=nfs4'
		;; *nfs4://nfs-server/exported/path*'?mountoptions=ro'

	CIFS/SMB directory tree:::
		There is no difference between cifs and smb scheme (any more). In both cases the 'cifs' filesystem is used. Additional 'mountoptions' can be passed as comma separated list. Defaults to "ro,guest". Specify "noguest" to turn off "guest". This is necessary if Samba is configured to reject guest connections.
		+
		Optional 'workgroup' or 'domain' parameter set the name of the workgroup. As alternative to passing 'username:password' in the URI authority the parameters 'user' and 'pass' can be used.
[horizontal]
		;; *smb://servername/share/path/on/the/share*
		;; *cifs://usern:passw@servername/share/path/on/the/share*'?mountoptions=ro,noguest'
		;; *cifs://usern:passw@servername/share/path/on/the/share*'?workgroup=mygroup'
		;; *cifs://servername/share/path/on/the/share*'?user=usern&pass=passw'

{nop}
~~~~~

*addrepo* (*ar*) ['options'] 'URI' 'alias':: {nop}
*addrepo* (*ar*) ['options'] 'FILE'*.repo*::
	Add a new repository specified by URI and assign specified alias to it or specify URI to a .repo file.
	+
	Newly added repositories have auto-refresh disabled by default (except for repositories imported from a .repo, having the auto-refresh enabled). To enable auto-refresh, use the *--refresh* option of the *modifyrepo* command.
	+
	Also, this command does not automatically refresh the newly added repositories. The repositories will get refreshed when used for the first time, or you can use the *refresh* command after finishing your modifications with **repo* commands. See also *METADATA REFRESH POLICY* section for more details.
+
--
	*-r*, *--repo* 'file'*.repo*::
		Read URI and alias from specified .repo file

	*-t*, *--type* 'type'::
		Type of repository (yast2, rpm-md, or plaindir) in case the autodetection fails. There are several aliases defined for these types:
[horizontal]
		*yast2* ;;	susetags, yast, YaST, YaST2, YAST
		*rpm-md* ;;	repomd, rpmmd, yum, YUM
		*plaindir*;;	Plaindir

	*-d*, *--disable*::
		Add the repository as disabled. Repositories are added as enabled by default.

	*-c*, *--check*::
		Probe given URI.

	*-C*, *--nocheck*::
		Don't probe URI, probe later during refresh.

	*-n*, *--name*::
		Specify descriptive name for the repository.

	*-k*, *--keep-packages*::
		Enable RPM files caching for the repository.

	*-K*, *--no-keep-packages*::
		Disable RPM files caching.

	*-f*, *--refresh*::
		Enable autorefresh of the repository. The autorefresh is disabled by default when adding new repositories.

	Examples: :: {nop}

		$ *zypper ar -c -n \'Packman 11.1 repo' http://packman.iu-bremen.de/suse/11.1 packman*;;
		Add a HTTP repository, probe it, name it 'Packman 11.1 repo', and use 'packman' as alias.

		$ *zypper ar http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/zypp:/svn/openSUSE_Factory/zypp:svn.repo*;; {nop}
		$ *zypper ar myreposbackup.repo*;;
		Add repositories from a .repo file.
--

*removerepo* (*rr*) ['options'] 'alias'|'name'|'#'|'URI'...::
	Delete repositories specified by aliases, names, numbers or URIs.
+
--
	*--loose-auth*::
		Ignore user authentication data in the URI

	*--loose-query*::
		Ignore query string in the URI
--

*repos* (*lr*) ['options'] ['repo']...::
	List all defined repositories or show detailed information about those specified as arguments
	+
	The following data can be printed for each repository found on the system: '#' (repository number), 'Alias' (unique identifier), 'Name', 'Enabled' (whether the repository is enabled), 'Refresh' (whether auto-refresh is enabled for the repository), 'Priority', 'Type' (repository meta-data type: rpm-md, yast2, plaindir). Which of the data is shown is determined by command line options listed below and the main.repoListColumns setting from zypper.conf. By default, #, Alias, Name, Enabled, and Refresh is shown.
	+
	Repository number is a unique identifier of the repository in current set of repositories. If you add, remove or change a repository, the numbers may change. Keep that in mind when using the numbers with the repository handling commands. On the other hand, using the alias instead of the number is always safe.
	+
	To show detailed information about specific repositories, specify them as arguments, either by alias, name, number from simple *zypper lr*, or by URI; e.g. fB *zypper lr factory*, or *zypper lr 2*.
+
--
	*-e*, *--export* 'FILE'*.repo*|'-'::
		This option causes zypper to write repository definition of all defined repositories into a single file in repo file format. If *-* is specified instead of a file name, the repositories will be written to the standard output.

Service Management
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The *services*, *addservice*, *removeservice*, *modifyservice*, and *refresh-services* commands serve for manipulating services. A service is specified by its URI and needs to have a unique alias defined (among both services and repositories).

Standalone repositories (not belonging to any service) are treated like services, too. The *ls* command will list them, *ms* command will modify them, etc. Repository specific options, like *--keep-packages* are not available here, though. You can use repository handling commands to manipulate them.

*addservice* (*as*) ['options'] 'URI' 'alias'::
	Adds a service specified by *URI* to the system. The 'alias' must be unique and serves to identify the service.
	+
	Newly added services are not refreshed automatically. Use the *refresh-services* command to refresh them. Zypper does not access the service URI when adding the service, so the type of the services is unknown until it is refreshed.
	+
	This command also allows to add also ordinary repositories when used with *--type* option, where you specify the type of the repository. See the addrepo command for the list of supported repository types.
+
--
	*-t*, *--type* 'type'::
		Type of the service (possible values: *ris*) in case the autodetection fails. There are several aliases defined for this type:
[horizontal]
		*ris* ;;	RIS, nu, NU

	*-d*, *--disable*::
		Add the service as disabled.

	*-n*, *--name*::
		Specify descriptive name for the service.
--

*removeservice* (*rs*) ['options'] 'alias'|'name'|'#'|'URI'...::
	Remove specified service from the system. Removing a service will also remove of all of its repositories.
+
--
	*--loose-auth*::
		Ignore user authentication data in the URI.

	*--loose-query*::
		Ignore query string in the URI.
--

*modifyservice* (*ms*) 'options' 'alias'|'name'|'#'|'URI':: {nop}
*modifyservice* (*ms*) 'options' *--all*|*--remote*|*--local*|*--medium-type*::
	Modify properties of specified services.
+
--
	Common Options::
		These options are common to all types of services and repositories.

	*-d*, *--disable*::
		Disable the service (but don't remove it).

	*-e*, *--enable*::
		Enable a disabled service.

	*-r*, *--refresh*::
		Enable auto-refresh of the service.

	*-R*, *--no-refresh*::
		Disable auto-refresh of the service.

		Also restore service repositories enabled/disabled state to the repository index default. Useful after you manually changed some service repositories enabled state.
--

Package Locks Management
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Package locks serve the purpose of preventing changes to the set of installed packages on the system. The locks are stored in form of a 'query' in /etc/zypp/locks file (see also locks(5)). Packages matching this query are then forbidden to change their installed status; an installed package can't be removed, not installed package can't be installed. When requesting to install or remove such locked package, you will get a dependency problem dialog.

*locks* (*ll*)::
	List currently active package locks.

*addlock* (*al*) ['options'] 'package-name'...::
	Add a package lock. Specify packages to lock by exact name or by a glob pattern using *** and '*?*' wildcard characters.
+
--
	*-r*, *--repo* 'alias'|'name'|'#'|'URI'::
		Restrict the lock to the specified repository.

	*-t*, *--type* 'type'::
		Lock only packages of specified type (default: package). See section *Package Types* for list of available package types.
--

*removelock* (*rl*) ['options'] 'lock-number'|'package-name'...::
	Remove specified package lock. Specify the lock to remove by its number obtained with *zypper locks* or by the package name.
+
--
	*-r*, *--repo* 'alias'|'name'|'#'|'URI'::
		Restrict the lock to the specified repository.

	*-t*, *--type* 'type'::
		Restrict the lock to packages of specified type (default: package). See section *Package Types* for list of available package types.
--

*cleanlocks* (*cl*)::
	Remove unused locks.
	+
	This command looks for locks that do not currently (with regard to repositories used) lock any package and for each such lock it asks user whether to remove it.


Other Commands
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
*versioncmp* (*vcmp*) 'version1' 'version2'::
	Compare the versions supplied as arguments and tell whether version1 is older or newer than version2 or the two version strings match.
	+
	The default output is in human-friendly form. If *--terse* global option is used, the result is an integer number, negative/positive if version1 is older/newer than version2, zero if they match.
+
--
	*-m*, *--match*::
		Takes missing release number as any release.

		For example: :::

			$ *zypper vcmp -m 0.15.3 0.15.3-2*;;
			0.15.3 'matches' 0.15.3-2

			$ *zypper vcmp 0.15.3 0.15.3-2*;;
			0.15.3 'is older than' 0.15.3-2
--

*targetos* (*tos*)::
	Shows the ID string of the target operating system. The string has a form of 'distroname-architecture'. The string is determined by libzypp, the 'distroname' is read from ('current-rootdir')*/etc/products.d/baseproduct* and the 'architecture' is determined from *uname* and 'CPU flags'.

*licenses*::
	Prints a report about 'licenses' and 'EULA's of installed packages to standard output.
	+
	First, a list of all packages and their licenses and/or EULAs is shown. This is followed by a summary, including the total number of installed packages, the number of installed packages with EULAs that required a confirmation from the user. Since the EULAs are not stored on the system and can only be read from repository metadata, the summary includes also the number of installed packages that have their counterpart in repositories. The report ends with a list of all licenses uses by the installed packages.
	+
	This command can be useful for companies redistributing a custom distribution (like appliances) to figure out what licenses they are bound by.

*download*::
	Download rpms specified on the commandline to a local directory.
	+
	Per default packages are downloaded to the libzypp package cache (*/var/cache/zypp/packages*; for non-root users *$XDG_CACHE_HOME/zypp/packages*), but this can be changed by using the global *--pkg-cache-dir* option.
	+
	In XML output a *<download-result>* node is written for each package zypper tried to download. Upon success the local path is is found in *download-result/localpath@path*.
+
--
	*--all-matches*::
		Download all versions matching the commandline arguments. Otherwise only the best version of
	each matching package is downloaded.

	*--dry-run*::
		Don't download any package, just report what would be done.
--

*source-download*::
	Download source rpms for all installed packages to a local directory.
+
--
	*-d*, *--directory* 'dir'::
		Download all source rpms to this directory. Default is */var/cache/zypper/source-download*.

	*--delete*::
		Delete extraneous source rpms in the local directory. This is the default.

	*--no-delete*::
		Do not delete extraneous source rpms.

	*--status*::
		Don't download any source rpms, but show which source rpms are missing or extraneous.
--

*ps*::
	After each upgrade or removal of packages, there may be running processes on the system which continue to use meanwhile deleted files. *zypper ps* lists all processes using deleted files, together with the corresponding files, and a service name hint, in case it's a known service. This gives a hint which services may need to be restarted after an update. Usually programs which continue to use deleted shared libraries. The list contains the following information:

[horizontal]
	*PID*;;		ID of the process
	*PPID*;;	ID of the parent process
	*UID*;;		ID of the user running the process
	*Login*;;	Login name of the user running the process
	*Command*;;	Command used to execute the process
	*Service*;;	Guessed name of the service. If an init script exists for this service, you can do "rcservicename restart" to restart it.
	*Files*;;	The list of the deleted files


GLOBAL OPTIONS
--------------

*-h*, *--help*::
	Help. If a 'command' is specified together with *--help* option, command specific help is displayed.

*-V*, *--version*::
	Print zypper version number and exit.

*-c*, *--config* 'file'::
	Use specified zypper config file instead of the default files. Other command line options specified together with *--config* and having their counterpart in the config file are still preferred. The order of preference with *--config* is as follows:

	. Command line options
	. *--config 'file'*
	. [*/etc/zypp/zypp.conf*] (system-wide defaults for all libzypp based applications)

+
{nop}	See also *FILES* section for more information.

*-v*, *--verbose*::
	Increase verbosity. For debugging output specify this option twice.

*-q*, *--quiet*::
	Suppress normal output. Brief (esp. result notification) messages and error messages will still be printed, though. If used together with conflicting *--verbose* option, the *--verbose* option takes preference.

*--*[*no-*]*color*::
	Whether to use colors in output if tty supports it. For details see the *[color]* section in *zypper.conf*.

*-A*, *--no-abbrev*::
	Do not abbreviate text in tables. By default zypper will try to abbreviate texts in some columns so that the table fits the width of the screen. If you need to see the whole text, use this option.

*-t*, *--terse*::
	Terse output for machine consumption. Implies *--no-abbrev* and *--no-color*.

*-s*, *--table-style*::
	Specifies table style to use. Table style is identified by an integer number. TODO

*-n*, *--non-interactive*::
	Switches to non-interactive mode. In this mode zypper doesn't ask user to type answers to various prompts, but uses default answers automatically. The behaviour of this option is somewhat different than that of options like *--yes*, since zypper can answer different answers to different questions. The answers also depend on other options like *--no-gpg-checks*.

*-x*, *--xmlout*::
	Switches to XML output. This option is useful for scripts or graphical frontends using zypper.

*-i*, *--ignore-unknown*::
	Ignore unknown packages. This option is useful for scripts.

*-D*, *--reposd-dir* 'dir'::
	Use the specified directory to look for the repository definition (*.repo*) files. The default value is */etc/zypp/repos.d*.

*-C*, *--cache-dir* 'dir'::
	Use an alternative root directory for all caches. The default value is */var/cache/zypp*.

*--raw-cache-dir* 'dir'::
	Use the specified directory for storing raw copies of repository metadata files. The default value is */var/cache/zypp/raw*.

*--solv-cache-dir* 'dir'::
	Use the specified directory to store the repository metadata cache database files (solv files). The default value is */var/cache/zypp/solv*.

*--pkg-cache-dir* 'dir'::
	Use the specified directory for storing downloaded rpm packages. (see *addrepo --keep-packages*) The default value is */var/cache/zypp/packages*.

*--userdata* 'string'::
	User data is expected to be a simple string without special chars or embedded newlines and may serve as transaction id. It will be written to all install history log entries created throughout this specific zypper call. It will also be passed on to zypp plugins executed during commit. This will enable e.g. a btrfs plugin to tag created snapshots with this string. For zypper itself this string has no special meaning.

Repository Options: :: {nop}

*--no-gpg-checks*::
	Ignore GPG check failures and continue. If a GPG issue occurs when using this option zypper prints and logs a warning and automatically continues without interrupting the operation. Use this option with caution, as you can easily overlook security problems by using it.

*--gpg-auto-import-keys*::
	If new repository signing key is found, do not ask what to do; trust and import it automatically. This option causes that the new key is imported also in non-interactive mode, where it would otherwise got rejected.

*-p*, *--plus-repo* 'URI'::
	Use an additional repository for this operation. The repository aliased tmp# and named by the specified URI will be added for this operation and removed at the end. You can specify this option multiple times.

*--plus-content* 'tag'::
	Additionally use disabled repositories providing a specific keyword. Disabled repositories are refreshed and those providing the specified 'tag' keyword are temporarily enabled. To enable for example repositories which may provide additional *-debuginfo* or *-debugsource* packages use *--plus-content debug*. You can specify this option multiple times.

*--disable-repositories*::
	Do not read metadata from repositories. This option will prevent loading of packages from repositories, thus making zypper work only with the installed packages (if *--disable-system-resolvables* was not specified).

*--no-refresh*::
	Do not auto-refresh repositories (ignore the auto-refresh setting). Useful to save time when doing operations like search, if there is not a need to have a completely up to date metadata.

*--no-cd*::
	Ignore CD/DVD repositories. When this option is specified, zypper acts as if the CD/DVD repositories were not defined at all.

*--no-remote*::
	Ignore remote repositories like http, ftp, smb and similar. This makes using zypper easier when being offline. When this option is specified, zypper acts as if the remote repositories were not defined at all.

*--releasever* 'version'::
	Set the value of the *$releasever* variable in all *.repo* files (default: 'current distribution version'). This can be used to switch to new distribution repositories when performing a distribution upgrade. See section *Repository Management* and the *dist-upgrade* (*dup*) command for details.
	+
	To check where you already use *$releasever* call: :::
		*zypper --releasever @--HERE--@ lr -u*

Target Options: :: {nop}

*-R*, *--root* 'dir'::
	Operates on a different root directory. This option influences the location of the repos.d directory and the metadata cache directory and also causes rpm to be run with the *--root* option to do the actual installation or removal of packages. See also the *FILES* section.

*--disable-system-resolvables*::
	This option serves mainly for testing purposes. It will cause zypper to act as if there were no packages installed in the system. Use with caution as you can damage your system using this option.


FILES
-----
*/etc/zypp/zypper.conf*, *$HOME/.zypper.conf*::
	Global (system-wide) and user's configuration file for zypper. These files are read when zypper starts up and *--config* option is not used.

*/etc/zypp/repos.d*::
	Directory containing repository definition ('\*.repo') files. You can use the Repository Management commands to manipulate these files, or you can edit them yourself. In either case, after doing the modifications, executing *zypper refresh* is strongly recommended.
	+
	You can use the *--reposd-dir* global option to use an alternative directory for this purpose or the *--root* option to make this directory relative to the specified root directory.
	+
	This directory is used by all ZYpp-based applications.

*/etc/zypp/services.d*::
	Directory containing service definition ('\*.service') files. You can use the Service Management Commands to manipulate these files, or you can edit them yourself. Running *zypper refs* is recommended after modifications have been done.
	+
	This directory is used by all ZYpp-based applications.

*/var/cache/zypp/raw*::
	Directory for storing raw metadata contained in repositories. Use the *--raw-cache-dir* global option to use an alternative directory for this purpose or the *--root* option to make this directory relative to the specified root directory.

*/var/log/zypp/history*::
	Installation history log.

*~/.zypper_history*::
	Command history for the zypper shell (see the *shell* command).


EXIT CODES
----------
There are several exit codes defined for zypper for use e.g. within scripts. These codes are defined in header file src/zypper-main.h found in zypper source package. Codes from interval (1-5) denote an error, numbers (100-105) provide a specific information, 0 represents a normal successful run. Following is a list of these codes with descriptions.

*0* - *ZYPPER_EXIT_OK*::
	Successful run of zypper with no special info.
*1* - *ZYPPER_EXIT_ERR_BUG*::
	Unexpected situation occurred, probably caused by a bug.
*2* - *ZYPPER_EXIT_ERR_SYNTAX*::
	zypper was invoked with an invalid command or option, or a bad syntax.
*3* - *ZYPPER_EXIT_ERR_INVALID_ARGS*::
	Some of provided arguments were invalid. E.g. an invalid URI was provided to the *addrepo* command.
*4* - *ZYPPER_EXIT_ERR_ZYPP*::
	A problem is reported by ZYPP library.
*5* - *ZYPPER_EXIT_ERR_PRIVILEGES*::
	User invoking zypper has insufficient privileges for specified operation.

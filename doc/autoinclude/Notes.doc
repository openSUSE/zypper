\section V_6_10_0  6.10.0 - Removed zypp::UpgradeStatistics
Since \c Code-11 the distribution upgrade is computed by the satsolver and no longer by
libzypp itself. For some reason zypp::UpgradeStatistics were still present in the interfaces,
but actually no longer used. Neither as input nor as result struct. Now they are removed.

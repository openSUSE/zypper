\section zypp-repovars-intro Repository Variables

Within a \c .repo or \c .serivce file, the name and URLs are subject to variable substitution.

Variables are e.g. usefull for related repositories like packman (<tt>http://ftp.gwdg.de/pub/linux/packman/suse/$releasever<\tt>), which shall always fit the installed distribution, even after a distribution upgrade. To help performing a distribution upgrade, the value of \c $releasever can be overwritten in zypper using the \c --releasever global option. This way you can easily switch all repositories using \c $releasever to the new version (provided the server layouts did not change and new repos are already available).

The variable expander also supports shell like definition of default and alternate values.

\subsection zypp-repoars-builtin Builtin repository variables

\li \c $arch -
	The system's CPU architecture.

\li \c $basearch -
	The base architecture of the system. For example, iX86 machines have a base architecture of \c i386, while AMD64 and Intel64 have \c x86_64.

\li \c $releasever -
	The version of your openSUSE or SUSE Linux. The value is obtained from the <tt>/product/version</tt> XML-node in <tt>/etc/products.d/baseproduct</tt>.

\li \c $releasever_minor
\li \c $releasever_major -
	\c $releasever_major will be set to the leading portion up to (but not including) the 1st dot; \c $releasever_minor to the trailing portion after the 1st dot. If there's no dot in \c $releasever, \c $releasever_major is the same as \c $releasever and \c $releasever_minor is empty.

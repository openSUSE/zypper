.SH "NAME"
zypper \- Command\-line interface to ZYpp system management library (libzypp)
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.sp
\fBzypper\fR [\fI\-\-global\-opts\fR] \fIcommand\fR [\fI\-\-command\-opts\fR] [\fIcommand\-arguments\fR]
.sp
\fBzypper\fR \fBhelp\fR \fIcommand\fR
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
zypper is a command\-line interface to ZYpp system management library (libzypp)\&. It can be used to install, update, remove software, manage repositories, perform various queries, and more\&.
.SH "CONCEPTS"
.sp
Most of the following concepts are common for all applications based on the libzypp package management library, but there are some zypper specifics\&.
.SS "Repositories"
.sp
Libzypp works with package metadata, that is information about packages and their relations extracted from RPM packages and other data like patch information, pattern definitions, etc\&. These data are stored together with the RPM files in folders called \fIrepositories\fR\&. Repositories can be placed on various media like an HTTP or FTP server, DVD, or a folder on a local disc\&.
.sp
There is a special set of commands in zypper intended to manipulate repositories\&. Also many commands and options take a repository as an argument\&. See section \fBCOMMANDS\fR, subsection \fBRepository Management\fR for more details\&.
.SS "Resource Identifiers (URI)"
.sp
To specify locations of repositories or other resources (RPM files, \&.repo files) you can use any type of URIs supported by libzypp\&. See section \fBCOMMANDS\fR, subsection \fBRepository Management\fR for a complete list and usage examples\&.
.sp
Zypper also accepts special URIs identifying openSUSE Build Service (OBS) repositories in the \fBaddrepo\fR command\&. These URIs have the form of \fBobs://\fR\fIproject\fR\fB/\fR[\fIplatform\fR], where \fIproject\fR is the name of the OBS project and \fIplatform\fR is the target platform (OS) for which the repository is intended\&. If \fIplatform\fR is omitted, the \fBobs\&.platform\fR value from zypper\&.conf is used\&. See also other options in the [obs] section of zypper\&.conf\&.
.sp
For example: \fBobs://server:http/openSUSE_11\&.3\fR\&.
.sp
In addition to these URIs you can use plain directory and file paths in which case zypper automatically treats them as \fBdir:/\fR\fIpath\fR URI\&.
.SS "Refresh"
.sp
Refreshing a repository means downloading metadata of packages from the medium (if needed), storing it in local cache (typically under \fB/var/cache/zypp/raw/\fR\fIalias\fR directory) and preparsing the metadata into \fI\&.solv\fR files (building the solv cache), typically under \fB/var/cache/zypp/solv/\fR\fIalias\fR\&.
.sp
The metadata get refreshed either automatically or on user request\&. An \fIautomatic refresh\fR takes place right before reading metadata from the database if the \fBauto\-refresh is enabled\fR for the repository and the metadata is reported to be out of date\&. If the \fIauto\-refresh is disabled\fR, the repository will only be refreshed on user request\&. You can request a refresh by calling \fBzypper refresh\fR (see the documentation of the \fBrefresh\fR command for details)\&.
.sp
The repository metadata are checked for changes before actually doing the refresh\&. A change is detected by downloading one or two metadata index files (small files) and comparing the checksums of the cached ones and the remote ones\&. If the files differ, the repository is out of date and will be refreshed\&.
.sp
To delay the up\-to\-date check (and thus the automatic refresh) for a certain number of minutes, edit the value of the \fBrepo\&.refresh\&.delay\fR attribute of ZYpp config file (\fB/etc/zypp/zypp\&.conf\fR)\&. This means, zypper will not even try to download and check the index files, and you will be able to use zypper for operations like search or info without internet access or root privileges\&.
.SS "Services"
.sp
Services are one level above repositories and serve to manage repositories or to do some special tasks\&. Libzypp currently supports \fIRepository Index Service\fR (RIS) and \fIPlugin Service\fR\&.
.sp
Repository Index Service (RIS) is a special type of repository which contains a list of other repositories\&. This list can be generated dynamically by the server according to some URI parameters or user name, or can be static\&. Once such service is added to your system, zypper takes care of adding, modifying, or removing these repositories on your system to reflect the current list\&. See section \fBService Management\fR and http://old\-en\&.opensuse\&.org/Standards/Repository_Index_Service for more details\&.
.SS "Package Types"
.sp
Zypper works with several types of resource objects, called \fIresolvables\fR\&. A resolvable might be a \fBpackage\fR, \fBpatch\fR, \fBpattern\fR, \fBproduct\fR; basically any \fIkind of object\fR with dependencies to other objects\&.
.PP
\fBpackage\fR
.RS 4
An ordinary RPM package\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBpatch\fR
.RS 4
A released patch conflicts with the affected/vulnerable versions of a collection of packages\&. As long as any of these affected/vulnerable versions are installed, the conflict triggers and the patch is classified as
\fBneeded\fR\&. Selecting the patch, the conflict is resolved by updating all installed and affected/vulnerable packages to a version providing the fix\&. When updating the packages zypper always aims for the latest available version\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBpattern\fR
.RS 4
A group of packages required or recommended to install some functionality\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBproduct\fR
.RS 4
A group of packages which are necessary to install a product\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBsrcpackage\fR
.RS 4
Source code package (\&.src\&.rpm)\&. This type works in
\fBsearch\fR
and
\fBinstall\fR
commands\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBapplication\fR
.RS 4
Focuses on packages a user might want to install and hide away supporting packages which are selected via package dependencies anyway (see
\fIhttp://people\&.freedesktop\&.org/~hughsient/appdata/\fR)
.RE
.sp
Throughout this manual we will often refer to resolvables simply as \fIpackages\fR and to resolvable types as \fIpackage type\fR or \fIkind\fR\&. These type names can be used as arguments of \fB\-\-type\fR option in several commands like \fBinstall\fR, \fBinfo\fR, or \fBsearch\fR\&. Commands should also allow to specify resolvables as \fIKIND\fR\fB:\fR\fINAME\fR (e\&.g\&. \fBpatch:openSUSE\-2014\-7\fR)\&.
.SS "Package Dependencies"
.sp
Software packages depend on each other in various ways\&. Packages usually \fIrequire\fR or \fIrecommend\fR other packages, but they can also \fIconflict\fR with other packages\&. Packages can also support specific hardware or language settings\&. Zypper uses a \fIdependency solver\fR to find out what packages need to be installed to satisfy the user\(cqs request\&. See http://old\-en\&.opensuse\&.org/Software_Management/Dependencies for more information\&.
.SS "Package File Conflicts"
.sp
File conflicts happen when two packages attempt to install files with the same name but different contents\&. This may happen if you are installing a newer version of a package without erasing the older version, of if two unrelated packages each install a file with the same name\&.
.sp
As checking for file conflicts requires access to the full filelist of each package being installed, zypper will check for file conflict only if all packages are downloaded in advance (see \fB\-\-download\-in\-advance\fR)\&.
.sp
As the reason for file conflicts usually is a poor package design or lack of coordination between the the people building the packages, they are not easy to resolve\&. By using the \fB\-\-replacefiles\fR option you can force zypper to replace the conflicting files\&. Nevertheless this may damage the package whose file gets replaced\&.
.SH "COMMANDS"
.sp
zypper provides a number of \fIcommands\fR\&. Each command accepts the options listed in the \fBGLOBAL OPTIONS\fR section\&. These options must be specified \fIbefore\fR the command name\&. In addition, many commands have specific options, which are listed in this section\&. These command\-specific options must be specified \fIafter\fR the name of the command and \fIbefore\fR any of the command arguments\&.
.SS "General Commands"
.PP
\fBhelp\fR [\fIcommand\fR]
.RS 4
Shows help texts\&. If invoked without any argument (just
\fBzypper\fR
or
\fBzypper help\fR), zypper displays global help text which lists all available global options and commands\&.

If invoked with a
\fIcommand\fR
name argument, zypper displays help for the specified command, if such command exists\&. Long as well as short variants of the command names can be used\&.

For your convenience,
\fBzypper help\fR
can also be invoked in any of the following ways:
.TS

.RE
.PP
\fBshell\fR (\fBsh\fR)
.RS 4
Starts a shell for entering multiple commands in one session\&. Exit the shell using
\fBexit\fR,
\fBquit\fR, or
\fICtrl\-D\fR\&.

The shell support is not complete so expect bugs there\&. However, there\(cqs no urgent need to use the shell since libzypp became so fast thanks to the SAT solver and its tools (openSUSE 11\&.0), but still, you\(cqre welcome to experiment with it\&.
.RE
.SS "Package Management Commands"
.PP
\fBinfo\fR (\fBif\fR) [\fIoptions\fR] \fIname\fR\&...
.RS 4
Displays detailed information about the specified packages\&.

For each specified package, zypper finds the best available version in defined repositories and shows information for this package\&.
.PP
\fB\-r\fR, \fB\-\-repo\fR \fIalias\fR|\fIname\fR|\fI#\fR|\fIURI\fR

.RE
.RE
.PP
\fBinstall\fR (\fBin\fR) [\fIoptions\fR] \fIname\fR|\fIcapability\fR|\fIrpm_file_uri\fR\&...
.RS 4
Install or update packages\&.
.PP
The packages can be selected by their \fIname\fR or by a \fIcapability\fR they provide\&.
.RS 4

A
\fIcapability\fR
is formed by "\fINAME\fR[\fB\&.\fR\fIARCH\fR][
\fIOP EDITION\fR]", where
\fIARCH\fR
is an architecture code,
\fIOP\fR
is one of
\fB<\fR,
\fB<=\fR,
\fB=\fR,
\fB>=\fR, or
\fB>\fR
and
\fIEDITION\fR
is "\fIVERSION\fR[\fB\-\fR\fIRELEASE\fR]"\&. For example:
\fBzypper=0\&.8\&.8\-2\fR
The
\fINAME\fR
component of a capability is not only a package name but any symbol provided by packages:
\fB/bin/vi\fR,
\fBlibcurl\&.so\&.3\fR,
\fBperl(Time::ParseDate)\fR\&. Just remember to quote to protect the special characters from the shell, for example:
\fBzypper\e>0\&.8\&.10\fR
or
\fB\*(Aqzypper>0\&.8\&.10\*(Aq\fR\&.

If
\fIEDITION\fR
is not specified, the newest installable version will be installed\&. This also means that if the package is already installed and newer versions are available, it will get upgraded to the newest installable version\&.

If
\fIARCH\fR
is not specified, or the last dot of the capability name string is not followed by known architecture, the solver will treat the whole string as a capability name\&. If the ARCH is known, the solver will select a package matching that architecture and complain if such package cannot be found\&.
.RE
.PP
Zypper is also able to install \fIplain RPM files\fR while trying to satisfy their dependencies using packages from defined repositories\&. You can install a plain RPM file by specifying its location in the install command arguments either as a local path or an URI\&. E\&.g\&.:
.RS 4

$
\fBzypper install ~/rpms/foo\&.rpm \fR\fBhttp://some\&.site/bar\&.rpm\fR\&.

Zypper will report packages that it cannot find\&. Further, in interactive mode, zypper proceeds with installation of the rest of requested packages, and it will abort immediately in non\-interactive mode\&. In both cases zypper returns
\fBZYPPER_EXIT_INF_CAP_NOT_FOUND\fR
after finishing the operation\&.

Zypper will download the files into its cache directory (/var/cache/zypper/RPMS), add this directory as a temporary
\fBplaindir\fR
repository and mark the respective packages for installation\&.
.RE
.PP
In the install command, you can specify also packages you wish to remove in addition to the packages you wish to install, by prepending their names by a \fI\-\fR or \fI~\fR character\&. For example:
.RS 4

$
\fI\fBzypper install vim \-emacs\fR\fR\ \&

$
\fBzypper remove emacs +vim\fR\ \&

will both
\fIinstall vim\fR
and
\fIremove emacs\fR\&. Note that if you choose to use
\fB\-\fR
with the first package you specify, you need to write
\fB\-\-\fR
before it to prevent its interpretation as a command option:

$
\fBzypper install \(em \-boring\-game great\-game great\-game\-manual\fR\ \&
.RE
.PP
\-r, \-\-repo alias|name|#|URI
.RS 4
Work only with the repository specified by the alias, name, number or URI\&. This option can be used multiple times\&.

Using \-\-repo is
\fIdiscouraged\fR
as it currently hides unmentioned repositories from the resolver, leading to inexpertly decisions\&. In the future \-\-repo will become an alias for
\fB\-\-from\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-t\fR, \fB\-\-type\fR \fItype\fR
.RS 4
Type of package to install (default: package)\&. See section
\fBPackage Types\fR
for list of available package types\&. Use
\fI\fBzypper se \-t\fR\fR\fI type\fR
[\fIname\fR] to look for available items of this type and
\fI\fBzypper info \-t\fR\fR\fI type name\fR
to display more detailed information about the item\&.

If
\fIpatch\fR
is specified, zypper will install and/or remove packages to satisfy specified patch\&. This is a way to ensure that specific bug fix is installed\&. Use
\fBzypper list\-patches\fR
to look for available
\fIneeded\fR
patches\&.

If
\fIproduct\fR
or
\fIpattern\fR
are specified, zypper ensures that all required (and optionally recommended) packages are installed\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-n\fR, \fB\-\-name\fR
.RS 4
Select packages by their name, don\(cqt try to select by capabilities\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-f\fR, \fB\-\-force\fR
.RS 4
Install even if the item is already installed (reinstall), downgraded or changes vendor or architecture\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-oldpackage\fR
.RS 4
Allow to replace a newer item with an older one\&. Handy if you are doing a rollback\&. Unlike \-\-force it will not enforce a reinstall, if the item is already installed with the requested version\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-from\fR \fIalias|name|#|URI\fR
.RS 4
Select packages from specified repository\&. If strings specified as arguments to the install command match packages in repositories specified in this option, they will be marked for installation\&. This option currently implies
\fB\-\-name\fR, but allows using wildcards for specifying packages\&.
.RE

\fB\-C\fR, \fB\-\-capability\fR
.RS 4

.RE
.PP
\fB\-l\fR, \fB\-\-auto\-agree\-with\-licenses\fR
.RS 4
Automatically say
\fIyes\fR
to third party license confirmation prompt\&. By using this option, you choose to agree with licenses of all third\-party software this command will install\&. This option is particularly useful for administrators installing the same set of packages on multiple machines (by an automated process) and have the licenses confirmed before\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-debug\-solver\fR
.RS 4
Create solver test case for debugging\&. Use this option, if you think the dependencies were not solved all right and attach the resulting /var/log/zypper\&.solverTestCase directory to your bug report\&. To use this option, simply add it to the problematic install or remove command\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-no\-recommends\fR
.RS 4
By default, zypper installs also packages recommended by the requested ones\&. This option causes the recommended packages to be ignored and only the required ones to be installed\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-replacefiles\fR
.RS 4
Install the packages even if they replace files from other, already installed, packages\&. Default is to treat file conflicts as an error\&.
\fB\-\-download\-as\-needed\fR
disables the file conflict check because access to all packages file lists is needed in advance in order to perform the check\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-R\fR, \fB\-\-no\-force\-resolution\fR
.RS 4
Do not force the solver to find a solution\&. Instead, report dependency problems and prompt the user to resolve them manually\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-force\-resolution\fR
.RS 4
Force the solver to find a solution by allowing to remove packages with unfulfilled requirements\&. This is the default when removing packages (\fBzypper remove *)\&. This option overrides *\-\-no\-force\-resolution\fR
in case both are specified on the command line\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-D\fR, \fB\-\-dry\-run\fR

\fIall\fR
packages in advance, which combines the advantages of
\fB\-\-download\-in\-advance\fR
and
\fB\-\-download\-as\-needed\fR\&. This is the default mode\&.

\fBdist\-upgrade\fR (\fBdup\fR) [\fIoptions\fR]

Perform a distribution upgrade\&. This command applies the state of (specified) repositories onto the system; upgrades (or even downgrades) installed packages to versions found in repositories, removes packages that are no longer in the repositories and pose a dependency problem for the upgrade, handles package splits and renames, etc\&.

If no repositories are specified via the
\fB\-\-from\fR
option, zypper will do the upgrade with all defined repositories\&. This can be a problem if the system contains conflicting repositories, like repositories for two different distribution releases\&. This often happens if one forgets to remove an older release repository after adding a new one, say openSUSE 13\&.1 and openSUSE 13\&.2\&.

For all repositories which have the distribution version within their URL (like
http://download\&.opensuse\&.org/distribution/\fI13\&.1\fR/repo/oss) using the
\fB$releasever\fR
variable instead may be helpful (http://download\&.opensuse\&.org/distribution/\fB$releasever\fR/repo/oss)\&. The variable is per default substituted by the current distributions version (\fI13\&.1\fR) This value can be overwritten using the
\fB\-\-releasever\fR
global option\&. Calling
\fBzypper \-\-releasever 13\&.2\fR\fI\&...\fR
will cause these repos to use the new location (http://download\&.opensuse\&.org/distribution/\fI13\&.2\fR/repo/oss) without need to add/remove anything\&. Once the
\fBdup\fR
is performed,
\fB$releasever\fR
will default to the new distribution version\&. See section
\fBRepository Management\fR
for more info about variable substitution\&.

Note: distribution upgrades in openSUSE are currently only supported between consecutive releases\&. To upgrade multiple releases, upgrade each consecutive release one at a time\&. For more details see

.RE

\fB$releasever\fR, \fB$releasever_major\fR, \fB$releasever_minor\fR

Use this variable to refer to the version of your openSUSE or SUSE Linux\&. The value is obtained from the
\fI/product/version\fR
XML\-node in
\fB/etc/products\&.d/baseproduct\fR\&.

This is useful for related repositories like packman (\fBhttp://ftp\&.gwdg\&.de/pub/linux/packman/suse/$releasever\fR), which shall always fit the installed distribution, even after a distribution upgrade\&. To help performing a distribution upgrade, the value of
\fB$releasever\fR
can be overwritten using the
\fB\-\-releasever\fR
global option\&. This way you can easily switch all repositories using
\fB$releasever\fR
to the new version (provided the server layouts did not change and new repos are already available)\&.

In addition
\fB$releasever_major\fR
will be set to the leading portion up to (but not including) the 1st dot;
\fB$releasever_minor\fR
to the trailing portion after the 1st dot\&. If there\(cqs no dot in
\fB$releasever\fR,
\fB$releasever_major\fR

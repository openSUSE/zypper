*--debug-solver*::
	Create solver test case for debugging. Use this option, if you think the dependencies were not solved all right and attach the resulting /var/log/zypper.solverTestCase directory to your bug report. To use this option, simply add it to the problematic install or remove command.

*--force-resolution*::
	Force the solver to find a solution by allowing to remove packages with unfulfilled requirements. This is the default when removing packages (*zypper remove*). This option overrides *--no-force-resolution* in case both are specified on the command line.

*-R*, *--no-force-resolution*::
	Do not force the solver to find a solution. Instead, report dependency problems and prompt the user to resolve them manually. This is the default except when removing packages (*zypper remove*).

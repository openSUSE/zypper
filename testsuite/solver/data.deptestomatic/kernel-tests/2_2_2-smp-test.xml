<!-- 
(2) KMP Update

    This case triggers when a KMP becomes available on an installation
    source ("catalog") that has a higher [epoch/]version/release number
    that the installed KMP.

    (2.2) The kABI of the kernel and of the KMP differ

      (2.2.2) A kernel of another flavor with the new kABI is available

	The resolver could propose to remove the current kernel, install
	the kernel that is compatible with the new KMP, and the new KMP.
	I don't think it is necessary to offer this solution, though.

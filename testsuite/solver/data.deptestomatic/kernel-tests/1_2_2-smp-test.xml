<!-- 
    (1.2) Kernel ABI has changed

      The KMPs and the kernel become incompatible. This results in
      a mismatch in kernel(name) = version Provides of the kernel and
      requires of the KMP. The resolver should indicate a conflict to
      be resolved interactively.
      (1.2.2) Updated some-kmp-$flavor packages are available, but
	      none for the flavor of the installed kernel

	Same result as (1.2.1).
